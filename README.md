# OLS-4: Building the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Association in Asia Region

Hello! :wave: 
Below are some ideas related to this project.

## Problem 
Open source projects are becoming more popular in tech industry. The RSE community has its presence in certain regions. We want to build the same in Asia region too. 

## Solution
We start by building a community where people can join each other.

## Key Metrics
Building of the infrastructure for the community, events for active participation 

## Resources Required
We need to build a website, need expertise to do so.  Also, we are getting the hang of Github for project management. Our emphasis is on creating a collaborative project maintained via GitHub and more.

## Contributor Profiles
Website design experts, GitHub experts, the global RSE community, and all those who want to join in our community to reap the benefits of RSE and community work.

## User Profiles
Anyone interested in RSE in general from Asian countries.

## Unique Value Proposition
There is no community as of now. We are building the infrastructure for the same. It would help people to join together.

## User Channels
We would gain new users via conducting simple group activities  like simple hackathons, book-reading, etc.

## Contributor Channels
By speaking to the OLS mentors and cohort, and also the global RSE society.
